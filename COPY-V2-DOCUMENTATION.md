## 🎨 Core Messaging Philosophy

### Utah AI Summit Values
1. **Always using AI to promote the betterment of mankind** at all levels (children, teens, adults, business) - never to replace humans
2. **People first** - AI and automation help people focus on building better solutions, systems, and education for other people
3. **AI is a companion, not a substitute** for humans

### 3-Pronged Approach (People • Teams • Business)
- **People/Individuals**: Empowerment, growth, confidence, capability
- **Teams**: Collaboration, synergy, effectiveness, working smarter
- **Business**: Success, impact, mission, serving customers better

### Key Messaging Patterns
- "AI as companion, not replacement"
- "Keeping people at the center"
- "Enhancing humanity, not replacing it"
- Individual empowerment → Team collaboration → Business success

## 📝 Notes for Team Review

### Key Questions to Consider:

3. Are there specific sections where the original copy was stronger?
